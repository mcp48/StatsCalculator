### Statistics Calculator Project

This is an expansion of the original calculator project to create a statistics calculator.  See below for links to the project outline and task list.  This project was done independently by myself, Michael Payne.  Any help I got was properly documented in the collaboration report that will be turned into the professor at the end of the term.
